Portugal Times

Portugal Times is a MERN application that provides news access to Portuguese citizens. After years of recession and debt, Portugal emerged from an economic crisis in 2017. This was largely due to increased revenue from new businesses and tourism which contributed to human trafficking prosecution rates spiking. Arrests related to drug cultivation and trafficking in Madeira this year have increased by more than 40% compared to the same period last year. Portugal Times is meant to be viewed on desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile. With our accessibility to all, we reach over 400,000 people a week with news in Portugal.

About Oppression

Oppression is malicious or unjust treatment or exercise of power, often under the guise of governmental authority or cultural opprobrium. Oppression refers to discrimination when the injustice does not target and may not directly afflict everyone in society but instead targets or disproportionately impacts specific groups of people.
